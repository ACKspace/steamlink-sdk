1. Execute the "build_steamlink.sh"
Once it's done, you should have the package ready to install in "steamlink-sdk/examples/retroarch/steamlink/apps".

Note:
You can create a "roms" folder in the current directory and copy some roms for testing before executing the script, the script will include them in the package.
Also, if you create a "extra" folder, you can copy compiled cores or any other file and they will also be included.
