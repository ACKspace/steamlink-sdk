# Cave Story port for Steam Link

It will pull most needed files automatically, however the new and remastered soundtrack have to be copied from an installation of Cave Story+ if you want it.
Put the files for the new soundtrack in ```music/new```, and the files for the remastered soundtrack in ```music/remastered```.

Make sure you have the [dependencies for building NXEngine](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-linux-version) installed.

## Currently not working
- Old music files (removed the menu option for now until the issue is solved)
- SDL GameController support
